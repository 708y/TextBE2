#summary Describes the environment and steps to build TextBE.

= Introduction =

TextBE is an Eclipse feature that consists of a set of plugins that are partly generated by model-driven tools and partly hand-written. This page describes the steps necessary to build TextBE 'by hand' using the Eclipse IDE.

This page is set up as a beginners guide, but its ultimate aim is to provide the information necessary to use [http://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/Build PDE Build] to generate the set using [http://jenkins-ci.org/ Jenkins] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration Continuous integration].

This page will give concrete version numbers. However users can and should attempt to use more recent versions, if the ones mentioned have become outdated.

= Build Environment =

To use this description install

 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP Windows XP Professional 32 Bit Service pack 3]. You must obtain a licence for this software.
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit Java SE 6 Update 30 JDK]. It is available from the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Oracle Java SE Downloads] page.
 * Eclipse Classic 3.7.1 (labeled '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)#Releases Indigo]') available from the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?osType=win32 Eclipse Downloads] page. At the time of this writing this revision [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.7.1-201109091335/eclipse-SDK-3.7.1-win32.zip R-3.7.1-201109091335 available through this link] *Note:* While TextBE requires numerous Modeling plugins to build, the *Eclipse Modeling Tools* version on the Indigo downloads page is still based on version 3.6 'Helios' of Eclipse. As a result, we need to assemble the required features by hand.

 
 = Installing Mylyn (Optional) =

 8.Now install the Google Code Mylyn Connector. In Eclipse go to Help->Install New Software 
9.In the "Work with:" field, type "http://knittig.de/googlecode-mylyn-connector/update/" 
 
= Making a TextBE Update =

  # Make a new workspace in Eclipse
  # Download the latest code from the svn respository
  # Generate code for required projects i.e.
    * org.be.textbe.bt.model/metamodel/textbt.cs => Generate Text Resource
    * org.be.textbe.ct.model/metamodel/textct.cs => Generate Text Resource
    * org.be.textbe.st.model/metamodel/textst.cs => Generate Text Resource
    * org.be.textbe.gv.model/metamodel/gv.genmodel => Generate Model Code
  # Update plugin versions
  # Update feature org.textbe-feature
  # Send feature to Toby to upload to update site
